In this demo app, you can view the current Bitcoin rate with live, real-time data. The app is built using the Provider package to manage state efficiently and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.

Key Features:
Live Bitcoin Rate: The app fetches real-time Bitcoin rates from a public API, displaying the current value in various currencies like USD, GBP, and EUR.

Provider for State Management: The app uses the Provider package to manage state across different widgets. This makes the app more efficient and easier to maintain, as changes in the data are automatically reflected in the UI.

MVVM Architecture: The app is structured following the MVVM pattern, which separates the business logic (ViewModel) from the UI code (View). The Model represents the data layer, which in this case is the Bitcoin data fetched from the API. The ViewModel handles the logic of fetching and processing the data, while the View displays the information to the user.

Clean and Scalable Codebase: By using MVVM and Provider, the app's codebase is organized, making it easier to scale and add new features in the future.

This approach ensures that the app remains responsive and easy to maintain, with a clear distinction between the data layer, business logic, and UI components.
